#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) since it has a linear runetime because when N gets bigger, the function will run longer.

b) This is two loops within one another. O(n^2)

c) O(n) this is also a linear function

## Exercise II

N is the input of number of stories
N is divided by 2 to get the middle index.
Then you check to see if it breaks or doesn't break at the middle index.
If it doesn't break, you add 1 floor and check again.
If it does break, you don't add a floor.
Then you will find the min floor where the egg breaks.
